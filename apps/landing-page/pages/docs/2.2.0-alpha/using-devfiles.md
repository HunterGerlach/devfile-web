A devfile is a `yaml` file. After you include it in your local
environment, the devfile provides ways to automate your processes. Tools
like `odo` run the devfile and apply its guidelines to your environment.
You can configure the devfile based on your unique development needs.
See the following documents to help you use a devfile based on your
