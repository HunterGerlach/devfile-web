A devfile is a `yaml` file. After you include it in your local
environment, the devfile provides ways to automate your processes. Tools
like `odo` run the devfile and apply its guidelines to your environment.
You can configure the devfile based on your unique development needs.
See the following documents to help you author a devfile based on your
development needs:

- [Adding schema version](./adding-schema-version)

- [Adding a name](./adding-a-name)

- [Adding projects](./adding-projects)

- [Adding commands](./adding-commands)

- [Adding components](./adding-components)

- [Adding attributes](./adding-attributes)

- [Adding event bindings](./adding-event-bindings)

- [Referring to a parent devfile in a devfile](./referring-to-a-parent-devfile)
