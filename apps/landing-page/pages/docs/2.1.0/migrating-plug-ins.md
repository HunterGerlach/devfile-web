This section describes how to migrate plug-ins to a v2.x devfile.

Additionally, v2.x devfiles include the following new features:

-   Parents allow users to reuse an existing devfile and partially
    replace plug-in functionality.

-   Eclipse Che IDEs and their tooling can be specified as attributes in
    a v2.x devfile or in a distinct YAML file, for example:
    `.che/che-editor.yaml` or `.che/che-theia-plugin.yaml`.
