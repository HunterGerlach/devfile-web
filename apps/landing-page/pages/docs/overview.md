A devfile is a `yaml` file. After you include it in your local
environment, the devfile provides ways to automate your processes. Tools
like `odo` run the devfile and apply its guidelines to your environment.
You can configure the devfile based on your unique development needs.
See the following documents to help you use a devfile based on your
development needs:

- [Adding schema version](./versions)

- [Adding a name](./metadata)

- {% versioned-link href="./adding-projects" text="Adding projects" /%}

- {% versioned-link href="./adding-commands" text="Adding commands" /%}

- {% versioned-link href="./adding-components" text="Adding components" /%}

- {% versioned-link href="./adding-attributes" text="Adding attributes" /%}

- {% versioned-link href="./referring-to-a-parent-devfile" text="Referring to a parent devfile in a devfile" /%}
