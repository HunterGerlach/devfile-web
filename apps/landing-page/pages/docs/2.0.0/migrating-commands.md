This section describes how to migrate plug-ins to devfile v2. There ARE
major changes in the `commands` section of the devfile. A command
specified in a v1.0 devfile will NOT work as it is in a devfile v2.0.

## Procedure

1. Command Groups: build,run,test,debug.

2. Apply Command.

3. Environment Varibables for a Specific Command.

4. Renaming workdir into workingDir.

5. Id and label for Composite Commands.

6. Run exec Commands as Specific User.

7. Devfile metadata: add a link to an external website.

8. Stack/Devfile Matching Rules.
