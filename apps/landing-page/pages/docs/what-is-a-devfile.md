You can use devfiles to automate and simplify your development process.
With devfiles, you record the instructions for configuring and running
your build environment as a YAML-formatted text file. Then, optionally,
you can distribute those devfiles to other build tools and IDEs that
support devfiles. Finally, to automatically configure and build a
running application from a development project, you run the devfile
instructions. You can also use devfiles to provide consistent build
processes across different languages and tools.

Using the recommended best practices from the devfile, the tools and IDE
can:

- Take in the repository hosting your application source code.

- Build your code.

- Run your application on your local container.

- Deploy your application to cloud-native containers.
