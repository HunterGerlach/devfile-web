This section describes how to migrate the `commands` section to a v2.x
devfile.

## Procedure

1. Command groups: build, run, test, debug.

2. Apply command.

3. Environment variables for a specific command.

4. Renaming workdir into workingDir.

5. Id and label for composite commands.

6. Run exec commands as specific user.

7. Devfile metadata: add a link to an external website.

8. Stack and devfile matching rules.
