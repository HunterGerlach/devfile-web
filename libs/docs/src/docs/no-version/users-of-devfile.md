Stack providers use devfiles to develop their runtime stacks once and
then use them across different tools. Therefore, with devfiles, you do
not need to build and maintain custom development tools.

Tool providers use devfiles to build runtime support for each runtime.
The devfile runtime teams create the devfiles for building and running
applications on their servers, giving you more time to work on your
tools.

With devfiles, developers do not need to set up the environment for
building and running their applications. Instead, you have the
flexibility to use different tools, like Che and `odo`.
